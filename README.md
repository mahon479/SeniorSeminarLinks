# Senior Seminar Project  

This repository contains the materials from my Computer Science senior seminar, completed at **University of Minnesota Morris**.  

## Project Overview  
The work explores concepts of **view synthesis, neural networks, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), ReNeRF, 3D scene representation,** and **image-based relighting**. For this project, I studied two academic papers in this area and authored a paper written for a broad audience to make these advanced concepts more accessible. 

- ðŸ“„ [Paper (PDF)](./MMahoneyPaper.pdf) â€” Written in LaTeX, demonstrating technical writing and research documentation skills  
- ðŸŽ¤ [Presentation (PDF)](./MMahoneyPresentation.pdf) â€” PowerPoint summarizing the key findings and contributions of the project
