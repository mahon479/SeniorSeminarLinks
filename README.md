# Senior Seminar Project  

This repository contains the materials from my Computer Science senior seminar, completed at **University of Minnesota Morris**.  

## Project Overview  
The work explores concepts of **view synthesis, neural networks, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), ReNeRF, 3D scene representation,** and **image-based relighting**. For this project, I studied two academic papers in this area and authored a paper for a broad audience, making these advanced concepts more accessible. 

### Paper  
[MMahoneyPaper.pdf](./MMahoneyPaper.pdf) — Written in LaTeX, demonstrating technical writing and research documentation skills  

### Presentation  
[MMahoneyPresentation.pdf](./MMahoneyPresentation.pdf) — PowerPoint summarizing the key findings and contributions of the project  
 
The official seminar page, where my paper and presentation are also listed, can be found here under the Spring 2025 tab:

## Skills Highlighted  
- **Research & Communication** — translating complex concepts found through research into accessible explanations  
- **PowerPoint Presentation Design** — creating clear and visually engaging presentation for audiences of various backgrounds and experience
